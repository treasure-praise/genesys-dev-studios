You’ll get to work alongside the Genesys team on projects and we’ll teach you how “the sauce” is made. By combining technology, design, and great ideas, your team will have the unique opportunity to collaborate with the Genesys team to bring your own concept to life, from the first pen sketches to the final functioning product. You’ll then get to show off your special project to everyone.</p>
